# RAG QnA Private Document using langchain, Pinecone and OpenAI

## Introduction

The RAG QnA Private Document Project is designed to provide users with a secure and efficient way to ask questions about the content of private documents. By leveraging the capabilities of LangChain, OpenAI, and Pinecone, this project allows for the seamless uploading of documents and querying of their contents using advanced natural language processing techniques. This ensures that the content is handled in a secure environment, minimizing the risk of exposure to third-party entities.

## Features

### 1. Secure Document Upload
- Users can upload their private documents in PDF format, which are then processed and stored securely. The system ensures that the content is not exposed to unauthorized parties.

### 2. Advanced Embedding and Retrieval
- The project utilizes Pinecone for indexing and storing document embeddings, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant document segments. OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model is used to create high-quality embeddings of the document contents.

### 3. Intelligent Q&A System
- Users can ask questions about the content of the uploaded documents. The system uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model to generate answers based on the most relevant sections of the document, retrieved using a similarity search.

### 4. Interactive Interface
- The project includes an interactive command-line interface where users can continuously ask questions and receive answers until they choose to exit. This interface supports a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Use Cases

1. **Legal and Compliance**: Organizations can use this tool to quickly extract relevant information from complex legal documents, compliance guidelines, or contracts.
2. **Research and Analysis**: Researchers and analysts can query specific sections of academic papers, reports, or other reference materials without manually searching through the entire document.
3. **Internal Documentation**: Companies can manage their internal knowledge bases, allowing employees to easily access specific information from policy documents, training manuals, and other internal resources.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the necessary API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone, and install the required Python packages.
2. **Document Upload**: Upload your document in PDF format using the provided functions.
3. **Indexing**: The system will automatically index the document and store it for future queries.
4. **Querying**: Use the interactive interface to ask questions and receive responses based on the document's content.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: The system is designed to handle sensitive documents with a focus on privacy. Document content is processed and stored securely, and the query responses are generated locally without sharing data with external servers.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can upload documents and access the query interface, ensuring that private information remains secure.

## Conclusion

The RAG QnA Private Document Project provides a robust and secure solution for querying private documents. It combines advanced NLP technologies with a focus on data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive use cases across various industries.
